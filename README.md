# Indiranagar-Metro-station-Bangaluru
Recreating the Indiranagar Metro Station, Bengaluru in Unity3D. With the metro station at the center recreating a 2x2sq.km area.

Unity Project `Supported Version: 2022.3.11f1`

### So I tried recreating the area using 
1. Cesium
2. BingMap
3. Google Map Platformer
4. Blackshark.ai

## Analysis 
1. Cesium amd Google Map Platformer 
> When tried with cesium and Google Map Platformer it help me provide a 2D representation of the area but as there was no photorealistic 3D model for this location or any pre-exisitng model present to import, It was not possible to create the 3D Representation in this much less time span.

### With Cesium (Google Map Platformer) demo 

2. BingMap
> It is api provided by Microsoft in which you could visualize the area on the earth with its 3D representation on the unity, but the same case happened with it there was no 3D model pre-trained for the bengaluru City specific.

### With BingMap demo
